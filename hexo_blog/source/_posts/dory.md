A dory is a 5-7 metre shallow-draft boat. It has a flat bottom, with some rocker, and is lapped with wide boards which are not steam bent. This makes it cheap to build and easy to land on shore. The narrow transom includes a sculling hole. A dory is voluminous and can carry a heavy cargo.

The early history of the dory is unclear. Precursors to the dory may have included the French bateau or the Irish Gandelow.

In the early 1900s, dories were replaced in the fisheries by motorised boats.
