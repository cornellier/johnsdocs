          <p>A dory is a small boat originally used for commercial fishery and now used for recreation. It has a shall draft and a flat bottom, making it easy to land on shore. It is lapped with wide boards which are not steam bent, making it cheap to build. The narrow transom includes a sculling hole.</p><p>The history of the dory is not well documented. Precursors likely include the faering, the nordlandsb√•t, and the bateau. It was developed for the Grand Banks fishing industory off Newfoundland in the 1800s, it's use spread south into New England. <i>Three Boys in a Dory with Lobster Pots</i>, at right, was painted there by Winslow Homer in 1875.</p>
          <p>Around the early 1900s, dories were replaced in the fisheries by motorised boats, but continue as recreational boats.</p>

          <p>We started <a href="canoe.html">canoe</a> tripping in Algonquin Park, then in Norway while we lived there, and lately in the Adirondacks. We were looking for a way to get on bigger bodies of water.</p>

          <p>While on a trip to Maine we learned about the Maine Island Trail Association. The MIT is described on their <a href="https://mita.org/">website</a> as <i>a 375-mile water trail for small boaters extending from the New Hampshire border to Canada ... it connects over 200 wild islands and mainland sites open for day use or overnight camping</i>.</p>
          <p>We found a YouTube video about a couple's camping holiday on the MIT in a <a href="http://www.clcboats.com/shop/wooden-sailboat-kits/northeaster-dory-sailing-kit/?jm=1">Northeaster Dory</a> they built themselves from a <a href="http://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/rowboats/northeaster-dory-rowing-sailing-kit.html">Chesepeake Light Craft</a> (CLC) kit.</p>
          <p>After cleaning out the garage, painting it white, and improving the lighting, the build began 20 February 2017. We started sandwiching together the components of the four bulkheads and the transom. This build requires a lot of clamps, and we found bags of 22 clamps for 10$ locally. To avoid wasteage, we got in the habit of mixing small batches of epoxy, working quickly. <a href="http://masepoxies.com/">MAS</a> supplied the chemicals and has good documentation on best practices.</p>
          <p>CLC cupplies the parts as CNC cut okoume BS 1088 marine grade plywood. For economic reasons the plywood is produced in 4x8 foot sheets. The length of the dory is 17 feet which means that some of the longer pieces have to be glued together from the 8ft plywood. </p>
