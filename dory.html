It has a flat bottom, with some rocker, making it easy to land on shore. It is lapped with wide boards which are not steam bent, making it cheap to build. The narrow transom includes a sculling hole.</p><p>

The history of the dory is not well documented, but precursors probably include the faering, the nordlandsb√•t, and the bateau. It was developed for the fishing industory in Eastern Canada and New England in the 1800s.</p><p>

In the early 1900s, dories were replaced in the fisheries by motorised boats, but continue as recreational boast.</p>
