<h2>History &amp; nomenclature</h2>

<p>A canoe is a light narrow boat, pointed at both ends and with no deck, propelled by one or more paddlers facing the direction of travel using a single-bladed paddle. In the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.canoeicf.com/">International Canoe Federation</a> and in parts of Europe <em>canoe</em> means <em>kayak</em>, while canoes are called <em>Canadian canoes</em>.</p>

<p>The word may come from the Carib kenu meaning <em>dugout</em>, via the Spanish <em>canoa</em>. Indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes. They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame. The canoes were light enough to be portaged, yet could carry a lot of cargo, even in shallow water. Canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America, with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in 1615. The first explorer to cross the North American continent, Alexander Mackenzie, used canoes extensively, as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition.</p>

<h2>Hull design</h2>

<p>Hull design must meet different, often conflicting, requirements for speed, carrying capacity, maneuverability, and stability. The canoe&#39;s hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Length: often stated as the overall length of the boat, but what counts in performance is the length of the waterline, and specifically that length relative to the displacement of the canoe. Displacement is the amount of water displaced by the boat. It is equal to the total weight of the boat and its contents, since a floating body displaces its own weight in water. When a canoe is paddled through water, it takes an effort to push all of the displaced water out of the way. Canoes are displacement hulls: the longer the waterline relative to its displacement, the faster it can be paddled.</li>
	<li>Width (beam): a wider boat provides more stability at the expense of speed. A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge, and a shorter boat needs a narrower beam to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water.</li>
	<li>Depth: a higher-sided boat stays drier in rough water. The cost of high sides is extra weight, extra wind resistance&nbsp;and increased susceptibility to cross-winds.</li>
	<li>Stability and bottom shape: the hull can be optimized for initial stability (the boat feels steady when it sits flat on the water) or final stability (resistance to capsizing). A flat-bottomed hull has high initial stability, while a rounded or V-shaped hull has high final stability. The fastest flat water canoes have sharp V-bottoms to cut through the water. But they are difficult to turn and have a deeper draft which makes them less suitable for shallows. Flat-bottomed canoes are most popular among recreational canoeists. At the cost of speed, they have shallow draft, turn better, and more cargo space.</li>
	<li>Keel: an external keel makes a canoe track (hold its course) better, and can stiffen a floppy bottom, but it can get stuck on rocks and decrease stability in rapids.</li>
	<li>Profile, the shape of the canoe&#39;s sides. Sides which flare out above the waterline deflect water but require the paddler to reach out over the side of the canoe. If the gunwale width is less than the waterline width or the maximum width the canoe is said to have tumblehome. This makes paddling easier.</li>
	<li>Rocker: viewed from the side of the canoe, rocker is the amount of curve in the hull, much like the curve of a banana. A straight keeled canoe, with no rocker, is meant for covering long distances in a straight line. The full length of the hull is in the water, so it tracks well and has good speed. As the rocker increases, so does the ease of turning, at the cost of tracking. Native American birch bark canoes were often characterized by extreme rocker.</li>
	<li>Hull symmetry: viewed from above, a symmetrical hull has its widest point at the center of the hull and both ends are identical. An asymmetrical hull typically has the widest section aft of center line, creating a longer bow and improving speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials and construction</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fiberglass is the most common material used in canoes.&nbsp;It&#39;s cheap, can be molded to any shape, and is easy to repair. Kevlar can be substituted but is more expensive. Boats are built by draping the cloth on a mold, then impregnating it with a liquid epoxy. A gel coat can be added to the hull for appearance.</li>
	<li>Stitch and glue</li>
	<li>Cedar strip: these are built by securing narrow, flexible strips of wood, usually cedar, edge-to-edge over a building jig that defines the shape of the hull. Once the strips are glued together, a transparent fiberglass and epoxy coating is applied to the canoe inside and out.</li>
	<li>Historical:
	<ul>
		<li>Royalex is a composite material comprising an outer ABS layer and an inner layer of ABS foam. Production of Royalex ceased in 2014.</li>
		<li>Aluminum: replaced by modern lighter materials.</li>
		<li>Bark: the indigenous peoples of eastern Canada and the northeast United States made canoes using the birch bark of the paper birch. The ribs of the canoe, called verons in Canadian French, were made of white cedar, and the hull, ribs, and thwarts were fastened using watap, a binding usually made from the roots of various species of conifers, such as the white spruce, black spruce, or cedar, and caulked with pitch.</li>
		<li>Canvas on wood frame: an evolution of the bark canoe with the use of ribs, and a waterproof covering.</li>

<h2>Symbolism</h2>

<p>In Canada, the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore, and is a symbol of Canadian identity. From 1935 to 1986 the Canadian silver dollar depicted a voyageur and an aboriginal paddling a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background.</p>

<p>The Chasse-galerie is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a night of heavy drinking on New Year&#39;s Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues (about 400 km) away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil. Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God&#39;s name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe. One version of this fable ends with the coup de gr&acirc;ce when, still high in the sky, the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns, so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls.</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>

<p>Although canoes were originally primarily a means of transport, with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft. John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books, and in 1866 founded the Royal Canoe Club in London and in 1880 the American Canoe Association. The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in 1900, and the British Canoe Union in 1936. Sprint canoe was a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The ICF was formed in 1946 and is the umbrella organization of national canoe organizations.</p>

<p>Sprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing. The paddler kneels on one knee, and uses a single-blade paddle. Canoes have no rudder, so the boat must be steered with a j-stroke. Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered. The minimum length of the opening on a C1 is 280 cm. Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam, which makes them very unstable. A C4 can be up to 9 m long and weigh 30 kg. ICF classes include C1 (solo), C2 (crew of two), and C4 (crew of four).</p>

<p>Marathons are long-distance races which may include portages. Under ICF rules minimum canoe weight is 10 and 14 kg for C1 and C2 respectively. Other rules can vary by race, for example in the <a href="http://www.classiquedecanots.com/">Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie</a> athletes race in C2s, with a maximum length of 5.6 m. The <a href="http://www.texaswatersafari.org/">Texas Water Safari</a>, at 422 km, includes an open class, the only rule being the vessel must be human-powered, and although novel setups have been tried, the fastest so far has been the six-man canoe.</p>
