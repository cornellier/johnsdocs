<p>Files and directories have permissions which define who can do what with them. This can be seen with ls, e.g.</p>

<pre>
$ ls -l foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 john develop 4564 Mar 30 14:17</pre>

<p>Which breaks down as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- indicates a regular file. Could also be d for directory, l for symbolic link, p for named pipe, s for socket, c for a character device, or b for a block device.</li>
	<li>rw-r--r-- are the file permissions, three sets of three characters. More about this below.</li>
	<li>1 is the number of links</li>
	<li>john is the owner name</li>
	<li>develop is the owner group</li>
	<li>4564 is the file size</li>
	<li>Mar 30 14:17 is the timestamp of the last modification</li>
</ul>

<p>The above can vary slightly for different files and can depend on the <a href="shell.html">shell</a> configuration.</p>

<p>For the permissions, there are three groups of three, the first for the owner, the second for the owner group, and the third for other.</p>

<p>The first of the three positions can be - or r, whether or readable or not, - or w, whether writable or not, and - or x, for executable. This is a symbolic representation of a binary number. - is zero, and a letter is 1. So --- is zero, --1 is one, -1- is two, etc. Each set of three values can be expressed as octal numbers. rw-r--r-- is 110 100 100, or in octal 6 4 4.</p>

<p>Permissions are changed with the chmod command. For example: $ chmod 777 foo $ ls -l foo -rwxrwxrwx [etc] $ chmod 644 foo -rw-r--r-- [etc] Another syntax for chmod is chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwxXst] file-or-dir So chmod 777 is equivalent to chmod a+rwx foo</p>

<p>Every user has a default setting for the permissions of anything they create. Usually this creates files with rw-r--r-- and directories with rwxr-xr-x. The umask can be set to something different with the umask command. The umask is subtractive. In Linux, the default permissions value is 666 for a regular file, and 777 for a directory. When creating a new file or directory, the kernel takes this value and subtracts the umask value, and gives the new files the resulting permissions. So if the umask is 022, then 666-022=044. The typical user default umask for files is 022.</p>

<p>Groups can be seen in the /etc/group file and with the groups command. Every user has a primary group. When a program is run or file is created they are associated with that group. To run programs or create a file in a different group, run the newgrp command, which makes another group the effective group. The chgrp command changes the group of a file.</p>
