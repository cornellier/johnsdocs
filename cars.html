<p>About two-thirds of the world's population (163 countries and territories) use RHT (right-hand traffic), with the remaining 76 countries and territories using LHT (left-hand traffic). Countries that use LHT account for a quarter of its roads. In 1919, half of the world's territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT. From 1919 to 1986, 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT. In the early 1900s some countries including Canada, Spain, and Brazil had different rules in different parts of the country. There has been a shift from LHT to RHT, mostly out of a desire to standardize with neighbours. Many remaining LHT jurisdictions are islands, and hence do not have land borders with RHT jurisdictions.
</p>
<p>There is no reason to prefer one side over the other. In healthy populations, traffic safety is thought to be the same regardless of handedness.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Whether the Romans preferred one side is unknown.
The first reference in English law to an order for LHT was in 1756, for London Bridge. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the French imposed RHT on parts of Europe.The first keep-right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike.
</p>
<p>In 1915 LHT was introduced everywhere in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later the Empire was split up into several countries, and they all changed eventually to RHT. Nazi Germany introduced RHT with almost immediate effect in Czechoslovakia in 1938-39.
</p>
<p>Sweden was LHT from about 1734 to 1967, despite having land borders with RHT countries, and virtually all the cars on the road in Sweden being left hand drive (LHD). A conversion took place at 5 am on Sunday, 3 September 1967. The accident rate dropped sharply after the change, but soon rose back to near its original level. Iceland switched the following year.
</p>
<p>In Europe, only four countries still drive on the left: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus, all of which are islands.</p>
<h2>The Americas</h2>
<p>The French introduced RHT to New France and Louisiana, the West Indies, and French Guiana. New York formalised RHT in 1804, New Jersey in 1813 and Massachusetts in 1821.</p>
<p>The British introduced LHT to Eastern Canada and British Columbia, British Guiana, and the Caribbean. While the Portuguese introduced it to Brazil. In South America most countries standardised to RHT in the 1930 and '40s. Guyana and Suriname are the only two remaining countries in the mainland Americas that drive on the left, being considered culturally part of the Caribbean, most of which is LHT.</p>
<h2>Africa</h2>
<p>RHT was introduced by the French in French West Africa and the Maghreb, among others.</p>
<p>LHT was introduced by the British in the East Africa Protectorate, Southern Rhodesia and the Cape Colony. The Portuguese introduced LHT in Mozambique, and Angola. Ghana switched from LHT to RHT in 1974.</p>
<p>Rwanda, a former Belgian colony, is RHT but is considering switching to LHT, to bring the country in line with other members of the East African Community.
</p>
<h2>Asia & the Pacific</h2>
<p>The British introduced LHT in New Zealand, Australia, India, South China and Hong Kong. Portugal introduced LHT in East Timor and Macao. China adopted RHT in 1946. Taiwan changed to driving on the right at the same time. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be LHT. Myanmar switched to RHT in 1970.</p>
<p>Samoa, a former German colony, had been RHT for more than a century. It switched to LHT in 2009, to allow Samoans to use cheaper right hand drive (RHD) vehicles imported from Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, and to harmonise with other South Pacific nations.</p>
<h2>Other transportation</h2>
<p>Water traffic is RHT. Light rail generally operates on the same side as other road traffic in the country. Many countries use RHT for automobiles but LHT for trains, because of the early influence of the British on railway systems. In some countries rail traffic remained LHT after automobile traffic switched to RHT, for example in China, Brazil, and Argentina. France, Belgium, and Switzerland have used RHT for automobiles since their introduction but operate trains using LHT.
