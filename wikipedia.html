<p>I try not to be a lurker, and when I consume something I try also to contribute to it. In 2004 I bought a used car, and having thoroughly researched it, decided to note my findings in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peugeot_405&oldid=2315465">brand new article about the Peugeot 405</a>. It's kinda fun that when you <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=peugeot+405&oq=peugeot+405&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60l2j0l2.3239j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Google that car</a> my old red car pops up first. There's no right-hand view because the right hand door got pushed by a hit & run.</p>
<p>Since then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cornellier">user cornellier</a> has made about 5,500 edits to Wikipedia, ranging from fixing typos, to reverting vandalism, to creating <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/created.py?name=Cornellier&server=enwiki&ns=,,&redirects=none"> 31 brand new articles</a>, and overhauling dozens more. Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Cornellier&offset=&limit=500&target=Cornellier">list of the last 500</a>.</p>
<p>Articles I started or overhauled generally involve subjects that have a direct interest for me. Articles I've put some effort into, and which largely still resemble my last edits, include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_skiing">history of skiing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_bridge">covered bridge</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck">pickup truck</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaubassin">Beaubassin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Adirondack Park</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time">unit of time</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic">right & left-hand traffic</a>.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking a break from Wikipedia, and using this site as my writing outlet. I've also captured some of my writings in abbreviated versions of the Wikipedia articles at <a href="canoe.html">canoe</a> and <a href="dory.html">dory</a>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia can be a rather humourless place, so it was with regret that I reverted the edit to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing">skiing</a>: <q>sking is the most shred gnar sport. you shred so much gnar that the gnar just shreds you. somtimes you just have to stop and think am i shreding to much gnar? but the truth is you can never shred enough gnar</q>.</p>
