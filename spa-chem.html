<p>You don&#39;t have to spend a lot of money on expensive and proprietary solutions to spa maintenance. You can use generic chemicals from the hardware store.</p>

<p>Quantities for my Jacuzzi J-270</p>

<ul>
	<li>390 gal / 1476 litres. (So in units per 1000 litres multiply by 1.476).</li>
	<li>CH: (calcium hardness) target: 200-250ppm</li>
	<li>TA (total alkalinity) target: 60-80</li>
	<li>CYA (cyaniuric acid) target: 40ppm</li>
	<li>pH target: 7.2 - 7.8. Lowering with Aquarius pH- (90-95% Sodium Bisulfate aka dry acid). To lower by 0.5 pH, add 22g of Sodium Bisulfate.</li>
	<li>Free chlorine target: minimum 3ppm. Put it in at 10, it goes down to 3 over two days, then add again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setup Calcium, CYA, and Borax are all done once when new water is added and do not need adjusting. The following can be done before the water has come up to operating temperature (100F). Testing is not dependent on water temperature, but the chemicals will dissolve faster in hot water.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Test for calcium hardness &amp; bring it up to 200-250ppm.</li>
	<li>Add CYA (cyanuric acid) to about 40ppm. Aquarius Stabilisateur d&rsquo;eau de piscine 900g available from Canadian Tire. Buy it in powder / granules, not tabs or sticks. It dissolves very slowly, so put it in a sock and hang it in the filter area. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troublefreepool.com/calc.html&quot;&gt;PoolMath&lt;/a&gt; says 2.2 oz by volume for my spa.</li>
	<li>Add Borax to 50ppm. Canadian Tire has TMT Multi-pupose Cleaner 2kg. Measure again and balance pH to 7.2 - 7.8 with baking soda (to increase) or pH Minus (to decrease). Balance alkalinity (TA) to 80-100 with baking soda (from grocery store)</li>
	<li>Pour in about 3-4 cups of liquid bleach to &ldquo;shock&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>Leave it alone two days or so then you can start using it. Maintenance About 8oz of bleach every other day if not used or 8oz/person after use. Then restart with 8oz the next day. Every two weeks check pH and Alka and adjust. Shocking should not be necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Log 2015-11-05:</p>

<ol>
	<li>After refill, CH tested by Club Piscine at 120ppm. Add 320ml Trevi Calcium+ to bring it up to 225.</li>
	<li>Add 65 ml of Aquarius Stabilisateur d&rsquo;eau de piscine powder from Canadian Tire for the CYA.</li>
	<li>Accidentally add 47g of Trevi Alca+. Add 651g of Borax to bring it to 50ppm borate. According to Taylor&rsquo;s and AquaCheck, pH and alkalinity are off the chart but stabilizer is good. Add 400g of Aquarius pH Reducer which is 90-95% Sodium Bisulfate. pH is at 7.8. TA is around 70. 2015-11-17: pH at 8.2 with no FC. Add 88g of Aquarius pH Reducer, lowered to 7.5. TA around 80 (with strip test).</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>Add water. Chlor 0. Alk 80. pH 6.</li>
	<li>Add 160ml Trevi Cal+.</li>
	<li>Add 650g Borax. Alk &amp; pH off the chart. Add 204g Spa Minus.</li>
	<li>Add 500ml bleach.</li>
	<li>Add 65 ml of Aquarius Stabilisateur d&rsquo;eau de piscine powder from Canadian Tire for the CYA.</li>
